The AI (chatGPT in this case) creating the base code definitely sped up the process more. It works like a template
that you can then adjust to your liking with the use of css and javascript if needed. I ran the question of "can you write me a html code for an interactive website" twice to see two different variations of the codes it would
give me.


“In this code, the media queries adjust the layout of the navigation menu and header for smaller screens. When the 
screen width is less than 600 pixels, the navigation menu items are displayed as block elements with margins, and 
when the screen width is less than 400 pixels, the font size of the header is increased and the navigation menu is 
hidden by default, with a toggle button to show/hide the menu. This code provides a basic example of how to make a 
website responsive, but there are many other techniques and best practices that can be used depending on the 
specific needs of the website.” (ChatGPT)


“In this example, we have a simple form that asks the user for their name, and a button that, when clicked 
triggers a Javascript function that displays a greeting message in an alert box. You can customise this code to 
add more interactivity” (ChatGPT)


Things that I added in myself was the channging images,content and the column design for the website but other that that I had a solid foundation to build from so I was able to use that to its potentional while also adusting thungs to my liking.
